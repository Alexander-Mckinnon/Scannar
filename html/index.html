         <p> Scannar is a mobile APP that allows you to use your phone to "scan" various objects with your phone's camera. After a picture of an object has been taken, scannar  will give you information about the object. The information you get depends on the nature of the object that has been scanned. For example, taking a picture of a movie poster will give you nearby locations of any theaters that are playing the movie, and the price of the tickets. Taking a picture of an animal such as a dog will give you information about the dog breed and where they can be found. Pictures of food and drink will reveal the name of said food and drink, nutritional information, and where to purchase them.  </p>
